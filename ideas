Use the iroh examples ticket idea to invite new nodes to group
The group owner will act as the server:
	* they have to be online for a new person to join
	* they enter the group id (topic key) which is then hashed and the joiner's node
	  sends a group request message over the topic
	* the owner then gets a join request and can accept the new joiner


Privacy protection:
	* If a node is not part of the owners group list than its messages are ignored through gossip.handler(fn)
	* The white list is managed by the group owner and updates are broadcasted to other members
	* Messages are encrypted after serialization
	* use endpoint.dial_direct(peer_nid)

	* Have an entryway topic that the group leader subscribes to and is open free for anyone to send to
	* Then the leader can send a invitation message including the name of the actual group topic for
	  the new member to join with

	* look into E2EE: https://docs.rs/mls-rs/latest/mls_rs/
